# Clock---MOGL
Created a clock with Modern OpenGL in C++ using the SDL, GLEW and GLM libraries. 
This was mostly done using a transformation matrix that differs for each shape being drawn unto the screen, the colors for each vertex can be changed depending on the users taste.
The clock runs using the specified time of the system it is being compiled on and all shapes drawn can be altered using each predefined matrix.

#MOGL here stands for "Modern OpenGL"
